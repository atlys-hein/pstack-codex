# Statechart

The chart shows how a system moves between states, in the words of the person who reads it. That person, the reader, decides whether the behavior is right.

## Run

Work in a task scratch folder outside the source repository. Check the available TypeScript runtime and `java -version`, and locate an existing TLC jar before running. Write a TLA+ spec and its config. Then run:

```sh
<skill dir>/scripts/statechart SPEC.tla [--config FILE] [--view FILE] [--out DIR]
```

Set `TLA2TOOLS` to an absolute TLC jar path and optional `JAVA` to a Java binary. Check [supported runtimes and dependencies](RESOURCES.md#compiler-and-dependencies). Missing prerequisites are reported; the command never installs tools.

View modules execute local JavaScript with the process's permissions. Inspect a supplied module before importing it. Use a new or empty `--out` directory; the CLI preserves nonempty destinations. Scratch files and generated models do not authorize changes to the system being modeled.

## Write the spec

- Write each rule that the reader agrees to as an INVARIANT. A rule can be about a screen, a result, a stored value, or a message. If the model has no variable for a rule, add the variable. Never weaken a rule to make it hold.
- Write `Next` as a disjunction of the actions, such as `YouPressPlay \/ YouPressStop`. If you do not, TLC names every step `Next`.
- A state with no step out breaks `NoDeadlock`, also when it is a correct end state. When an INVARIANT or a PROPERTY already has that name, the rule is `CHECK_DEADLOCK`. Add to `Next` an action that is true only in the end states and changes nothing, such as `Done == phase \in {"paid", "failed"} /\ UNCHANGED vars`, and give it a label in `step()`.

## Pick the chart

You do the work that needs judgment: the words on each state and arrow, the phases and their colors, the title, and the report to the reader. Put your work in a view module, and give it with `--view`.

To show the reader's words, the view exports `state(vars)`. The value that `state()` returns picks the form:

- A string gives a flat chart: `export const state = (v) => (v.paid ? "Paid" : "Paying");`
- An array gives parent states: `export const state = (v) => v.main.split(".");`
- An object gives one parallel region for each key: `export const state = (v) => ({ Playback: v.playback, Volume: v.volume });`

Label each state with what the reader can see or cares about, such as "Paying" or "Lease held, write pending". Keep variable names out of labels. In `vars`, a TLA+ sequence is an object with keys from 1, so `v.pc[1]` is `pc[1]`. A set is an array.

The view can also export `step(action, from, to)`. It gets the TLC action name and the values before and after the step, and it returns the label of the arrow. Write each step label as the user sees it happen, such as "you press play" or "the connect fails". Do not name the code or the TLA+ action. Two actions that end the same in the chart get the same label, so that they share one arrow.

When a step can occur only in some conditions, end its label with the condition in brackets, in the reader's words, such as `you press play [while the file loads]`. In a regions chart, the command writes the condition on the other regions on the arrow, in the words of their labels, such as `[when Offline]`. Your brackets replace it, and two arrows from one state can then look the same. So in a regions chart, do not write brackets for a condition on another region. When a value that no label shows decides where a step goes, name the result in the label, such as "the roster read fails".

The view can also export these:

- `group(vars)` returns the name of a phase. Each chart state gets the color of its group. When the model states behind one chart state are in different groups, that state gets no color.
- `colors` gives each group name a color class.
- `title` is a string that the chart shows at the top.

The command calls `state()` and `group()` at most once for each model state, and `step()` at most once for each step. The chart and the report both use those answers. So make each function depend only on its arguments.

The chart does not draw a step that stays in one label. Split a label when the reader must see such a step.

Aim for about 20 arrows or fewer, because a busier chart is hard to read. First return coarser labels from `state()`. Give one label to values that act the same, and leave out a detail that the reader does not need, such as a call in flight whose return changes nothing. Keep each state of a bug path, and keep each mark. When a merge changes a `breaks` state to `mayBreak`, it hides where a rule breaks. Do not merge two states that break different rules, because the reader then cannot see which rule breaks where. If the chart is still too busy, return `null` from `step()` for the steps that the reader does not need, such as a reset that every state has, or a step whose arrow repeats what other arrows show. Obey these rules when you hide steps:

- Keep each chart state reachable by arrows from a start state.
- Keep at least one arrow out of each chart state that has a step out in the model.
- Hide all the steps of an arrow, or none of them. When you hide only some, its condition gets narrower.
- In the hand-off, say which steps the chart hides.

## Read the report

Read [the report semantics](RESOURCES.md#interpret-the-report) before interpreting the chart or handing it off. They define bug marks, representative states, constraint boundaries, unchecked rules, and TLC output. Keep rules that break, hold, or were not checked distinct. A rule that was not checked may hold or break.

## Show the chart

Show `chart.mmd` to the user as a `mermaid` code block. The chart has a budget of 500 states, counted by TLC on the config as written. Above that, the chart draws only the paths to the rules that break, and when no rule breaks, the command writes no `chart.mmd`. It still checks each rule, and the report gives the state count and each bug path. To see the whole graph, make the model smaller.

When the user asks for an image, or a chart is too large to read as text, follow [the rendering guide](references/render.md). Use the optional Pele renderer when available. Report its absence and provide the Mermaid text when rendering cannot run. Use another renderer only when the user asks for it.

## Hand off

Give each chart and its Mermaid text to the person who must decide. Add one line for each bug: the rule, the reader's sentence for that rule, and the path as the report numbers it. Say what the model leaves out. Give the command that makes the files again, with a new `--out` folder.

When the model describes code, replay each bug path against the real code within the authorized scope, as a test or a live repro, one step for each action. A read-only request does not authorize source edits. If execution needs unavailable access or an unapproved side effect, report that specific unverified path. If a bug does not occur, treat the model as wrong until evidence shows otherwise.
